This repository contains the term project for the CS301: Introduction to Algorithms course, focusing on the Longest Simple Circuit (LSC) problem. This problem is a classic NP-complete challenge, which involves finding the longest possible simple cycle in an undirected graph. The project report outlines the theoretical background, algorithmic approaches, and performance evaluation of various heuristic methods designed to address this complex problem.

The project explores two heuristic algorithms with distinct trade-offs between speed and solution quality. Additionally, three improvement algorithms are applied to enhance the initial results without affecting the overall time complexity. The report includes a detailed analysis of algorithm correctness, complexity, and experimental performance across various test cases, including random graphs and edge cases. By leveraging techniques like depth-first search (DFS) and random vertex selection, the heuristics aim to provide faster solutions than exact algorithms, especially for larger graphs.
